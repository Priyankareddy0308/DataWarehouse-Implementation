#### Data Exploration:
We were presented with data from Fudgemart, inc. which has 
two subsidary companies called FudgeMart and FudgeFlix

#### Business Case:
Revenue Streams across different geographical locations

#### High level Modeling:
Developed a high level modeling sheet with Facts and Dimesions required to analyse the revenue streams across different locations

#### Detailed Dimension Modeling:


#### ETL 
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is used to pull the data out of the database and stage it to perform data manipulations 
After manipulation data is  pushed into the warehouse. We have two different databases here one for fudgemart and one for fudgeflix.
We pulled the data related to the business case from both database into a single stage. Staged data is transformed to the required schema.

# Business Intelligence Visualizations
Used Power BI for visualizations to get Summarized insights from the data
